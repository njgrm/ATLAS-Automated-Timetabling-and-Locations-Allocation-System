# EnrollPro API Reference

Last reviewed: 2026-07-24

## Purpose and Source of Truth

This is the code-verified catalog of routes mounted by `server/src/app.ts`. EnrollPro is the single source of truth for learner and personnel identity, enrollment, grade and section placement, and school-year context.

For the operational sequence from BOSY through EOSY and rollover, see [ENROLLPRO-SCHOOL-YEAR-LIFECYCLE.md](./ENROLLPRO-SCHOOL-YEAR-LIFECYCLE.md).

## Runtime Bases

- Local API: `http://localhost:5002/api`
- Configured API: `<ENROLLPRO_BASE_URL>/api`
- Partner API: `<ENROLLPRO_BASE_URL>/api/integration/v1`
- Uploaded assets: `<ENROLLPRO_BASE_URL>/uploads/*`

The configured host may be local, private-network, or deployed. Companion systems call the HTTP API and must never connect directly to the EnrollPro PostgreSQL database.

## Authentication and School-Year Scope

| Mode | Transport | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staff JWT | `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `enrollpro_session` cookie, or compatibility `token` query parameter | Protected staff and teacher routes |
| Learner JWT | `Authorization: Bearer <learner-token>` | `/api/learner` self-service routes |
| Integration key | `X-Integration-Key: <secret>` or `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` | ATLAS, SMART, and AIMS integration feeds |
| MRF service key | `X-Integration-Key: <secret>` or `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` | `/api/integration/v1/default/mrf/identities` |
| Public | No credential | Public application and reference-data feeds |

Protected API calls may send `x-school-year-context-id: <positive integer>`. If absent, EnrollPro resolves `SchoolSetting.activeSchoolYearId`, then the latest active school year. Partner v1 feeds use `schoolYearId`; feeds documented as optional fall back to the active year.

Role names used below are `SYSTEM_ADMIN`, `HEAD_REGISTRAR`, `CLASS_ADVISER`, `TEACHER`, `LEARNER`, and `MRF`.

## Response, Pagination, and Error Conventions

Partner feeds normally return:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "meta": {
    "generatedAt": "2026-07-11T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Internal routes may return a resource directly or a feature-specific envelope. Common partner query parameters are `schoolYearId`, `page`, and `limit`; integration lists default to 50 and cap at 200 unless stated otherwise.

Common errors are:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "schoolYearId must be a positive integer"
  }
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | Invalid path, query, or body value |
| `401` | Missing or invalid session, JWT, or integration key |
| `403` | Authenticated identity lacks the required role |
| `404` | Resource does not exist in the selected school year |
| `409` | Duplicate or concurrent-state conflict |
| `422` | Valid request cannot be applied in the current lifecycle state |
| `500` | Unexpected server failure |
| `503` | External subsystem or required dependency is unavailable |

## Consumer Matrix

| Consumer | Primary EnrollPro endpoints | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SMART | `/integration/v1/default/smart/students`, `/integration/v1/sections`, `/integration/v1/sections/:sectionId/learners` | Grade-encoding masterlists and archived EOSY reconciliation |
| AIMS | `/integration/v1/default/aims/context`, `/integration/v1/sections`, `/integration/v1/default/faculty` | LMS classrooms, learner program context, and remedial flags |
| ATLAS | `/integration/v1/default/faculty`, `/integration/v1/sections`, `/integration/v1/school-year` | Scheduling, faculty load, advisership, and section context |
| MRF | `/integration/v1/default/mrf/identities` | Keyed learner, teacher, staff, and MRF-role identity reconciliation |
| EnrollPro frontend | All protected feature routes and `/events/stream` | Registrar, teacher, learner, and administration workflows |

## Platform and Realtime

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Public | Basic EnrollPro liveness response |
| GET | `/api/events/stream` | Staff JWT | Browser SSE invalidation stream with 25-second heartbeat |
| GET | `/uploads/*` | Public asset | School logo and uploaded document assets |

The SSE stream emits `invalidate` events with typed topics and optional school-year, learner, teacher, and section IDs. It supports browser cache invalidation; companion systems should use their own scheduled or event-driven synchronization.

## Authentication

Base path: `/api/auth`

| Method | Path | Auth and roles | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/login` | Public | Authenticate an active staff account and issue staff session data |
| POST | `/verify` | Public | Verify staff credentials for SMART, AIMS, or ATLAS without creating an EnrollPro staff session |
| POST | `/logout` | Public | Clear the staff authentication cookie |
| GET | `/me` | Staff JWT | Return the authenticated staff profile |
| PATCH | `/change-password` | Staff cookie or bearer fallback | Change the authenticated staff password |
| PATCH | `/external/change-password` | Five-minute password-change ticket | Replace a default password during a companion-system login handoff without issuing an EnrollPro staff session |

If `/verify` receives valid credentials for an account with
`mustChangePassword=true`, it denies companion-system login with HTTP `428` and
returns `code: PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED`, a relative `passwordChangePath`, and
an absolute `passwordChangeUrl`. Companion systems should send their exact
login page as `returnTo`; EnrollPro signs that destination into the ticket and
redirects back to it after the password is replaced. The path contains a
short-lived, single-purpose ticket in
the URL fragment. SMART, AIMS, and ATLAS must open that EnrollPro path in a
popup or full-page handoff. After the existing EnrollPro password form succeeds,
the companion system must ask the user to sign in again with the new password.
The ticket cannot be used as a normal staff session.

Learner authentication is mounted under `/api/learner`, not `/api/auth`.

| Method | Path | Roles | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/pending` | Registrar, admin | Conditionally promoted and remedial-hold cases |

The remedial queue is read-only in EnrollPro. EnrollPro does not accept a manually encoded summer grade or academic outcome. A remedial hold remains blocked until a reviewed SMART remedial-result contract is available and the published SMART outcome can be validated server-side.

| GET | `/exports/sf6` | Registrar, admin | School-wide SF6 JSON export |

SF5 and SF6 GET routes are previews or downloads. Only the POST recording
routes create official immutable artifacts. School closing and new-year
activation occur only through `/api/school-years/rollover`.

## Teacher Advisory Roster

Base path: `/api/teacher-advisory`; the route allows adviser, teacher,
registrar, and admin roles.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Load the authenticated teacher's current advisory roster as a read-only view |

This API does not accept grades or EOSY submissions. SMART is the only source
of grades, learning-area results, and promotion outcomes.

## Personnel Directory

Base path: `/api/teachers`; all routes require `HEAD_REGISTRAR` or `SYSTEM_ADMIN`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Personnel directory |

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/template` | Download a blank copy of the official SF7 workbook template |
| POST | `/import/preview` | Parse one `.xlsx` or `.csv` SF7 roster up to 10 MB and return proposed matched-personnel updates without writing |
| POST | `/import/commit` | Commit approved preview rows to matched personnel SF7 profile fields |
| POST | `/sync-atlas` | Synchronize published ATLAS schedule assignments into `TeacherSchedulePeriod` for the selected school year |

Preview uploads use multipart field `file`. Import never creates a login account automatically. ATLAS matching uses EnrollPro `employeeId` as the external employee code.

## Administration and Audit

Base path: `/api/admin`

| Method | Path | Auth and roles | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/users/metrics` | `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | Account metrics |

| GET | `/system/health` | `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | Server, database, and runtime health |
| GET | `/dashboard/stats` | `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | Administration dashboard metrics |

Base path: `/api/audit-logs`. Full audit routes require `SYSTEM_ADMIN`.
Self-service routes require an authenticated staff account and always scope
results to the signed-in user's ID.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/me` | Paginated activity performed by the signed-in user |
| GET | `/me/filters` | Action filters from the signed-in user's activity |
| GET | `/` | Paginated audit trail |
| GET | `/filters` | Available actors, actions, and subjects |
| GET | `/export` | CSV audit export |
| POST | `/atlas-override` | Record manual ATLAS schedule override |

## Exports

Base path: `/api/export`; routes require `HEAD_REGISTRAR` or `SYSTEM_ADMIN`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |

| GET | `/lis-master` | Export LIS masterlist |
| GET | `/sf7?schoolYearId=:id` | Synchronize available ATLAS schedules and export the official template-based SF7 compliance workbook |

## Integration Triggers

Base path: `/api/integration`

| Method | Path | Auth and roles | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/smart/sections/:id/sync-grades` | EnrollPro staff JWT, `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | EnrollPro to SMART, then SMART to EnrollPro | Pull and transactionally store strict final published outcomes by LRN from SMART `/api/integration/sections/:sectionId/sync-grades` |
| POST | `/atlas/sync-faculty` | `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | EnrollPro to ATLAS trigger | Ask ATLAS to reconcile EnrollPro faculty |
| GET | `/atlas/faculty/:id/teaching-load` | Staff JWT | ATLAS to EnrollPro proxy | Read a teacher's ATLAS assignments |

The SMART outbound request uses the server-only `SMART_API_KEY` in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header. EnrollPro rejects duplicate or unmatched LRNs and school-year mismatches. Learners with incomplete subject grades, `NG`, a null promotion status, or no final rating remain unresolved and stay marked `Action Required`; no fallback grades or promotion results are fabricated. Optional SMART publication and revision metadata are stored when supplied.

## Partner Integration v1

Base path: `/api/integration/v1`

Existing ATLAS, SMART, and AIMS endpoints are now key-protected for machine-to-machine service integration. The MRF feed is also service-key protected. All payloads are DPA-minimized for their stated consumer.

| Method | Path | Auth | School-year scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Public | None | EnrollPro DB plus ATLAS, AIMS, and SMART connectivity |
| GET | `/school-year` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Resolve school-year ID and label (defaults to the environment's `SchoolSetting.activeSchoolYearId` if absent) |
| GET | `/learners` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Paginated current or archived learner roster |
| GET | `/students` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Alias of `/learners` |
| GET | `/faculty` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Paginated faculty and designation context |
| GET | `/teachers` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Alias of `/faculty` |
| GET | `/staff` | Integration key | Not school-year bound | Active EnrollPro staff accounts, excluding MRF compatibility role |
| GET | `/sections` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Sections, grade levels, capacity, count, and adviser |
| GET | `/sections/:sectionId/learners` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | Current or archived section roster |
| GET | `/default/faculty` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | ATLAS-ready active faculty feed |
| GET | `/default/smart/students` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | SMART-ready current or archived grade roster |
| GET | `/default/aims/context` | Integration key | Optional `schoolYearId` | AIMS-ready current or archived learner context |
| GET | `/default/mrf/identities` | `X-Integration-Key` | Optional `schoolYearId` | MRF learner, teacher, staff, and MRF-role identity groups |

### MRF Identity Feed

Configure the EnrollPro server with `MRF_INTEGRATION_API_KEY` and send the value in `X-Integration-Key`. Missing, unconfigured, or incorrect keys return `401 INVALID_INTEGRATION_KEY`.

```bash
curl "$ENROLLPRO_INTEGRATION_BASE_URL/default/mrf/identities?schoolYearId=12" \
  -H "X-Integration-Key: <service-key>"
```

The response groups `learners`, `teachers`, and `staff`. It includes stable identifiers, names, roles, account status, employee ID or LRN, and current grade and section where applicable. It excludes passwords, birthdates, family details, medical information, and audit-security fields.

### Current and Archived Rosters

Current feeds include applications in `OFFICIALLY_ENROLLED` status that have an `EnrollmentRecord`. For an archived school year, learner, SMART, AIMS, section roster, and MRF feeds read `EnrollmentHistory` and identify the historical source in metadata.
