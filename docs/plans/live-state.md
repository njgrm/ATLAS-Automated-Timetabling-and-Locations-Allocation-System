# ATLAS Live State

Current operational truth only. Git history and handoff documents retain older
evidence. Update this file when a live fact, blocking decision, or next action
changes.

Last reconciled: 2026-09-25 (Lane A).

## Writing protocol — three planner lanes share this file

This file is co-maintained so three planners can work in parallel without a custody defect. The
rules are what make that safe:

1. **Each lane edits only its own section** — `Lane A`, `Lane B` or `Lane C — current lane` —
   plus the `Live release` block **when it deployed**. Never rewrite another lane's section. If a
   merge conflicts inside another lane's section, **take theirs** and move on.
2. **Every blocker or "not done" line carries `as of <date>` and what proves it.** An undated
   pending line is a premise error waiting to happen (`AGENTS.md` §15): on 2026-09-21 a session
   spent a packet, an independent review and a dispatch on a term-cache apply that had already been
   satisfied three days earlier. **Before acting on any blocker line, verify it against the runtime
   or the database** — or delete it.
3. **Keep it short.** No narrative, no history, no per-transition register. Packets, evidence,
   handoffs and Git hold the detail.
4. Per-lane detail lives in each lane's own handoff: Lane A in
   `docs/handoffs/planner-session-handoff.md`, Lane B in its own handoff file, Lane C in its
   section below until a stream needs a handoff.

## Objective

Deliver a presentable live ATLAS demo for school 1 and active upstream school
year 10 (SY 2031-2032): correct Teaching Load, a dynamic term-aware timetable,
realistic official exports, zero HARD publication blockers, SMART-family visual
cohesion across the whole site, and direct two-way SSO with EnrollPro, SMART,
and AIMS.

Shared sections trimmed by Lane C on 2026-09-25 (operator instruction). Superseded release blocks,
resolved blockers and older acceptance notes are in Git: `git show 0b70ea0a:docs/plans/live-state.md`.

## Live release

- Tailnet: `https://njgrm.buru-degree.ts.net`
- **Release SHA: `c5e167d7c5939ff586880149c566ce29506430e8`** (**LIVE** since 2026-09-25 20:40, Lane A;

  target; health 200, ready 200 `database:"ok"`, DB-backed subjects read 200, Tailnet 200; served target entry
  `assets/index-BW9wl1o-.js` SHA-256 `40E58645…294BC1`, byte-identical local/Tailnet/build; old entry 404. Independent
  post-action QA `ACCEPT_READY` **8/8/0/0**; six-table zero-write signature unchanged. R1 browser rows are accepted
  at 1366×768 and 390×844 (`docs/handoffs/lane-a-browser-acceptance-c5e167d7-r1-2026-09-25.md`); the earlier
  collaboration-ticket incident remains preserved in the separate incident handoff. Two EnrollPro proxy 502s remain
  non-blocking residuals. **No migration. Rollback basis: `ad8f9717`.**
- **Pending release SHA: `eb0e30386336673a4a31ecfe39a9bef93549e0ed`** (target recorded 2026-09-25 before the
  §13 deployment action; planned release directory `E:\ATLAS-runtime-supervised-eb0e3038-20260925`; incumbent and
  rollback basis `c5e167d7c5939ff586880149c566ce29506430e8` at
  `E:\ATLAS-runtime-supervised-c5e167d7-20260925`; production delta is two server service files plus the committed
  server test/script (`generation-readiness.service.ts`, `timetable-candidate-domain.ts`, test, package script), with
  docs/config changes carried by `origin/main`; **no migration**; deployment not yet run. Source review accepted;
  corrected packet lint `AUDIT_CLEAR` **6/6/0/0** at `f1dc67b4`; explicit §13 approval is still pending. Post-cutover
  acceptance owner: Lane C reloads `/timetable` twice after Q4's cold/warm API proof and reads the new stall lines;
  no generation, publication, or timetable-data write is authorized.)
- **Release SHA: `ad8f9717`** (rollback basis; previously LIVE 2026-09-25 17:12, Lane C; `E:\ATLAS-runtime-supervised-ad8f9717-20260925`;
  operator cutover, audit `C:\ProgramData\ATLAS\release-audit\ad8f9717-20260925-171136`; active state
  `running`/`ad8f9717`; machine env = target; health 200, `/health/ready` `database:"ok"`, subjects read 200, Tailnet
  200; served `assets/index-DEoaxzaH.js` byte-identical to the build). **Browser acceptance: UNPERFORMED as of
  2026-09-25** — the operator generated draft run 318 before the demo, so `/timetable` opens an unpublished draft
  and the published teacher-leaving rows (B1 commit, B2 refusal) no longer apply to the screen; see the Lane C
  handoff `docs/handoffs/lane-c-handoff-2026-09-25-stall.md`.
  `DEPARTURE-LOAD-C05`: a privileged teacher change on the published timetable moves the class's subject+section
  Teaching Load ownership to the new teacher in the same transaction as the revision (receiver department/program +
  active checks; audit carries `teachingLoadTransfers`); already-authorized receivers transfer nothing; the
  teacher-leaving check shows teacher-caused refusals; server error codes are read from real axios errors (also
  fixes the stale-source message in four consumers). Commits `463cd9fa` + corrections `e6aeff4f`, `ad8f9717`;
  integrated as merge `6e992878`. Independent review `ACCEPT_READY` (2026-09-25, after two bounded corrections).
  **No migration.** **Rollback basis: `82871619`.** Operator decisions (2026-09-25): ownership moves at scheduling
  time, not on the effective date, and withdrawing the revision does not revert Teaching Load — **accepted**; one
  live teacher-leaving commit on test data (Tolentino → Villanueva, Jose Gabriel) is **approved** for acceptance.
  Browser acceptance owner: Lane C.
- **Release SHA: `82871619`** (**LIVE** since 2026-09-25 14:41, Lane C; `E:\ATLAS-runtime-supervised-82871619-20260925`;

  SHA-256 byte-identical to the build). **Browser acceptance (Lane C, 2026-09-25): 3 passed / 1 blocked /
  1 unperformed** — Step 4 with 20 clashes scrolls by mouse wheel, footer visible; Tue MATH ↔ Thu ENG (GR7 Luna,
  T2) now shows only the real Aquino clash (no self-section/room clash), Tue ↔ Thu MATH clean; preview zero-write
  (revisions/runs/manual-edits hashes identical). **Blocked:** Step 5 unreachable — every replacement for
  Tolentino fails HARD `FACULTY_SUBJECT_NOT_QUALIFIED` because no other teacher holds her subject+section
  Teaching Load assignments (authority by design; the published teacher-leaving flow needs Teaching Load
  reassigned first). **Unperformed:** room-name clash in browser (no room clash arose; unit-proven).
  `DEPARTURE-SWAP-C04`: teacher-leaving Step 4/5 scroll; a published swap only pairs classes in the same term
  (client) and the server refuses cross-term swaps (422 `SWAP_TERM_MISMATCH`); clash text names rooms. Integrated
  on `main` as merge `bc2608d6` (code tree identical to `82871619`). Independent QA `ACCEPT_READY` 7/0/1
  (2026-09-25). **No migration** (no `prisma/**` change). **Rollback basis: `ff87b06b`**. Deviation (2026-09-25, operator-directed
  pre-demo release): `E:` at 47–49 GiB (< 50 GiB warning) and the release-directory reclaim was **not** run
  before this build; it is Lane C's first action after the demo.

  Cut over by the SHA-pinned `ops/runtime/deploy-runner.ps1` (audit

  `searchable-select` a11y). **No Prisma, migration, generation, publication, or timetable-data change.**
  Client-only regression baseline verified independently: full client suite 970 / **955 pass / 15 fail**, the

  `PLANNER_DECISION_REQUIRED` 6/7 — row 5d (authenticated live zero-write) is
  `EXTERNALLY_BLOCKED(AUTH_SESSION_REQUIRED)`; the planner accepted the structural zero-write proof (preview
  returns before any create/update/delete; caller asserts the preview outcome) plus the 401 gate control; no

     retained beyond immediate depth; compatible.
  Every other `*/ATLAS-runtime-*` directory is beyond rollback depth: a retention-reclaim candidate, except
  the named last-resort artifacts (`docs/reference/agent-worktree-lifecycle.md`).
- **Acceptance debt (as of 2026-09-25):** `066da7a7`, `37e0c85b`, `a5f7384e` and `002c8879` each shipped

## Live data

- Database: `atlas_recovery_clean_rebuild_20260905` on localhost:5432. Active upstream year: 10; mirror row 551.
- Published run **317 / revision 43** (as of 2026-09-24): zero HARD, 289 acknowledged SOFT warnings;
  public surface `source.runId=317`, `activeRevisionId=43`, `snapshotState=FROZEN`, 920 entries.
- Building `gradeScope`: buildings 1–4 = `[7]`, `[8]`, `[9]`, `[10]` (HIGH apply accepted). Rollback: restore
  buildings 1–4 to empty integer arrays, then rerun the same preview.
- Regeneration and publication have not been authorized or executed since the grade-scope correction.

## Open items carried forward (unverified since the date shown — verify or delete before acting)

- SMART/AIMS direct federation (as of 2026-09-20): the runtime supports EnrollPro only; SMART/AIMS activation
  waits on companion-side routes, directional keys, deployment and live browser acceptance. Companion repos
  stay read-only; generate/install no directional keys until both sides consume the agreed names.
- Page-level UX (as of 2026-09-20): `UX-R02`–`UX-R05` open; `UX-R03c` (`/timetable/runs`, `/setup`,
  `/exports` sub-pages and chrome overrides) is the named successor.
- Double policy fetch (as of 2026-09-20, NON_BLOCKING): `SchedulingPolicyPane.tsx` and
  `useScheduleReviewWorkspaceState.ts` both GET `/policies/scheduling/{schoolId}/{schoolYearId}`; give it one owner.
- Host-proxy 502 `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE` / `read ECONNRESET` (observation O1, 2026-09-21): host-side, server-side
  cause uninvestigated. Findings: `docs/reviews/dup-read-diagnosis-c01/findings.md`.
- `uxc01-derived-setup-surface.test.ts` 1-of-4 red on a `navigation.ts` substring assertion (as of 2026-09-20);
  a LOW test-contract correction was queued.

## Operator decisions

- Whole-site UX converges on SMART's calm task-first identity while ATLAS keeps its complex Teaching Load and
  Timetable workflows.
- Direct two-way SSO is required for EnrollPro, SMART and AIMS. No account or role may be auto-provisioned or
  elevated through SSO. The operator authorizes generating the SMART/AIMS directional keys and ATLAS
  durable-env edits after reviewed source consumes the agreed names.
- Generation/publication require zero HARD violations; SOFT warnings stay explicit and auditable.
- Laboratory scheduling is optional for future beneficiaries and disabled for the current pilot.
- **Standing authorization (2026-09-20):** for this program the operator authorizes HIGH actions, deployment
  and browser acceptance without a per-action approval round-trip, provided every gate and test is retained
  (pre-action review, one executor, one fresh post-action QA, browser rows labelled, a real
  `passed/blocked/unperformed` tally). Standing authorization removes waiting, never evidence (`AGENTS.md` §13).
- **Three planner lanes (operator, 2026-09-25):** Lane A = opencode (primary; client timetable surface,
  deployment); Lane B = Codex (server lane; the browser agent acceptance is usually deferred to); Lane C =
  Claude Code. Disjoint file ownership, one runtime swapper at a time, one browser controller at a time.

## Decisions awaited (operator-facing, as of 2026-09-25)

- Give `37e0c85b` (acceptance owner: Lane B / Codex) and the C7 target an authenticated session (see `AGENTS.md` §12).
- `E:` is under its 50 GiB warning: authorize the release-directory retention reclaim before the next build.
- Keep or delete two unlanded code branches (both pushed): `work/public-published-view-term-merge-c01`,
  `work/timetable-live-term-authority-c01`.

## Lane B — current lane (written only by Planner B)

**e475c673 browser acceptance (2026-09-25): PARTIAL — passed 4 / blocked 0 / unperformed 1.**
Authenticated read-only browser QA at 1366×768 and 390×844 confirmed the current-schedule-unchanged
notice, exactly one **Check school information** action to `/timetable/setup`, descriptive collapsed
grade morning/afternoon schedules without `Override #n`, no document overflow, and no console errors.
The browser network-event stream produced no observable events after a fresh reload, so the network
regression row is **UNPERFORMED**, not passed. Non-blocking accessibility residual: visually collapsed
shared-accordion child inputs remain exposed to keyboard/AX. No scheduling data changed; the session
tab remains open. Evidence owner: Lane B (Codex).
Closure worktree: `E:\ATLAS-worktrees\lane-b-e475-browser-acceptance` is clean, merged, has no reparse
or process borrower, and is `RETIRE_AFTER_INTEGRATION` (E: 47.55 GiB before retirement).

## Lane C — current lane (written only by Lane C)

Opened 2026-09-25 (operator). Branches `work|fix|docs/lane-c-*`, worktrees `E:/ATLAS-worktrees/lane-c-*`. Finished
cycles are in Git history and their handoffs. Claude Code lanes follow `CLAUDE.md` (cost rules).

**Current stream: server stall** (as of 2026-09-25 21:40). Root cause found with SERVER-STALL-C01 live in
`c5e167d7`: `GET …/readiness/diagnostic` (every `/timetable` load) ran `runHybridScheduler` synchronously,
blocking the loop 3.1 s offline / 6.9–7.8 s live (stall lines 12:47, 12:57, 13:07, 13:11Z). A browser swap preview
on run 318 (Tue MATH ↔ Thu MATH 10:00) answered in 668 ms; the operator's 31.7 s case (Thu 10:45 ENG) was not
re-run and is presumed queued behind readiness stalls.

**READINESS-STALL-C01 `5376a5c9` integrated 2026-09-25** (merge `ad23ef84` on `integration/readiness-stall-c01`;
executor Sonnet, QA Sonnet `ACCEPT_READY`). HH:MM parse memo + readiness-only scheduler-result cache keyed by
sha256 of the full scheduler input (bounded 8, cloned out; real generation uncached). Output deep-equal to the live
build for school 1 / year 10; loop block 4,314 → 1,175 ms cold, 4,161 → ~120 ms warm; `test:readiness-stall` 7/7,
`test:request-timing` 6/6, server-suite 337/341 (4 pre-existing `tt-output-c03r`), Node start on 5198. No migration.
NON_BLOCKING: `canonicalStringify` maps Map/Set to `{}` (no Map/Set reaches the input today); T2's failing-first
was an import failure, not behavioural.

**Waiting (2026-09-25 22:10):** the elevated deployer owns the `eb0e3038` cutover and its post-action QA rows Q1–Q8
(packet `docs/prompts/deploy-eb0e3038-readiness-stall-2026-09-25.md`). **Next Lane C action:** once Q1–Q8 report
`ACCEPT_READY`, run packet row **A1** (two production `/timetable` reloads, both readiness responses
`scheduler.cached === true`, no new readiness-attributable `[event-loop-stall]` line) and record it in the Live
release block. Then ask the operator what else was "broken" in manual draft placements.

**Open (2026-09-25):** EnrollPro unreachable from the host — Tailscale `dev-jegs` offline since ~19:40 local;
`runtime/context`/`sections/summary` wait the 4 s timeout (not a loop block). F1–F3
(`docs/handoffs/lane-c-browser-acceptance-e8553752-2026-09-25.md`); A3 (0 class advisers); delete remote
`work/wonderful-sagan-nhz302`, `work/epic-galileo-cw0swp`. `E:` 59 GiB free (21:40).

## Lane A — current lane (written only by Lane A)

**Current stream (2026-09-25):** `TEACHER-CONCERN-AUTHORITY-PROGRAM-20260924` C1–C7 is complete. The scheduler is
the single teacher-concern accommodation surface, SMART's draft access is teacher-scoped/read-only, and the ATLAS
teacher portal is removed. The latest accepted product tip and verified live release is `c5e167d7`.

**Completed acceptance (2026-09-25):** `ACTIVE-TERM-LIVE-RESOLUTION-C01` fixed the former C7
`409 TERM_SCOPE_MISMATCH`: Lane A's seeded browser pass returned `/faculty/concerns` GET 200 and PUT 200 at
`termIndex 2`, with D6 redirects and removed navigation verified. One disclosed test-data mutation remains: a
DRAFT availability for faculty 1 / year 10 / term 2 / v1 with zero slots.

**Deployment outcome (2026-09-25):** operator-approved `c5e167d7` cutover is **DEPLOYED**; independent post-action
QA `ACCEPT_READY` **8/8/0/0**; zero-write digest unchanged; rollback basis `ad8f9717`. The first browser attempt
issued an unexpected collaboration-ticket POST 201; that incident remains preserved in
`docs/handoffs/lane-a-browser-acceptance-c5e167d7-2026-09-25.md`. Fresh ticket-contract QA verified process-local,
one-time, 60-second, school/year/run-scoped state with no Prisma or timetable-domain write. Lane A's second pass
accepted the R1 pixel rows at both viewports: primary timetable text 14px, deliberate 12px flag/special-cell
exceptions, no global scrollbar, and only the disclosed ticket POST; evidence is
`docs/handoffs/lane-a-browser-acceptance-c5e167d7-r1-2026-09-25.md`. Two EnrollPro proxy 502s remain non-blocking
residuals.

**Next action (2026-09-25):** Lane C runs the separate draft-swap/stall-diagnostic acceptance on the deployed target;
Lane A's R1 browser rows are closed. No further Lane A browser action is required unless a new source or live-state
change requires re-verification.

**Dated decisions / residuals (verify before acting):**
- **F7 remains deliberately rejected (2026-09-25):** daily tools stay under More so the header remains compact;
  reverse only on explicit operator instruction.
- **Stage-2 successor (unowned, 2026-09-25):** pre-resolve the active term at generation/publication entry points
  and thread it into their transactions; do not perform a live fetch inside Serializable/advisory-locked work.
- `ad8f9717` browser acceptance is **UNPERFORMED (2026-09-25)** because the operator generated draft run 318; its
  published-teacher-leaving rows no longer describe the current screen. Acceptance remains separate from deployment.
- `UX-AUDIT-SIZE-C01` R1 fixed audit finding 4 in source (`fb245772`, QA 6/6/0/0, integrated `c5e167d7`); only
  the live pixel rows remain. Findings 3 and 6 are addressed on main; finding 9 was already addressed.
- `resolvePublishedRunTermIndex` still uses base-snapshot export terms (F1), and availability drift repair still
  targets `/faculty` rather than `/faculty/concerns` (F2); both were open residuals on 2026-09-25.
- Host-proxy 502/offline term-cache staleness remain unowned observations from 2026-09-24. The removed `/my/*`
  route smoke fixture remains a D6 cleanup follow-up as of 2026-09-25.

**Custody / workspace (2026-09-25):** Lane A owns the seeded browser profile and this docs worktree
`E:\ATLAS-worktrees\lane-a-r1-deploy-target` (`docs/lane-a-r1-deploy-target`, `KEEP_ACTIVE` until the target record
is pushed). Do not write in Lane B/C worktrees. E: and D: were both 61.6 GiB free at takeover, above warning.
