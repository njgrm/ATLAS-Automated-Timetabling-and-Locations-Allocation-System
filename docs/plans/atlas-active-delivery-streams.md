# ATLAS Active Delivery Streams

Last reconciled: 2026-09-11 (Asia/Manila)

This is the current operational register for executor, QA, integration, and
operator-action streams. Historical phase plans and per-stream ledgers are
evidence, not alternate status boards. Only the primary planner or integration
owner updates this file.

## Current objective

Complete an understandable EnrollPro-driven rollover into one authoritative
derived-demand flow, preserve prior-year Teaching Load as visible history with
an optional audited carry-forward, and reach one generated schedule with zero
hard blockers before separately approving publication.

## Current coordination snapshot

- Readiness-wave cycle `readiness-wave-20260911` (CYCLE_ACTIVE): GEN-C02R1
  (`6f7b3c52...b1348113`), UX-C01R (`89440321...9e280369`), and TL-RR01R
  (`95ceedf9...f66ca392`) each passed a fresh independent QA (`ACCEPT_READY`,
  only NON_BLOCKING documentation/coverage findings). GEN-C02R1 is integrated at
  merge `c3744dc6` and UX-C01R is integrated at merge `fc8796c6`; TL-RR01R
  awaits independent integration. Combined client/server type-checks, builds,
  focused suites, disposable-PostgreSQL zero-write checks, `git diff --check`,
  and an isolated built-server mount probe passed on both integration trees.
  The dirty `D:/ATLAS` checkout is not an integration boundary.
- Cycle recovery: objective = intake, independently QA, correct if necessary,
  and integrate the GEN-C02R1 + UX-C01R + TL-RR01R readiness wave; planner
  session = primary planner (OpenCode); QA child tasks
  `ses_f6f668ffcffe1ULPdPjVT04A7C` (GEN), `ses_f6f66737affeT2ec6hA674pxcm` (UX),
  `ses_f6f665c6cffeQ8ofy3A5E64vGS` (TL); executor sessions GEN
  `ses_f6fb5354fffevESkJSuYmHRG89`, UX `ses_f6fa23afeffeHXHQUV1mss1zia`, TL
  `ses_f6fa64129ffesWoUEEEwKJdImK`; worktrees `integration-term-consume-c02` /
  `ux-c01-derived-setup` / `tl-rr01r`; candidates `b1348113` (integrated),
  `9e280369` (integrated), `f66ca392` (next); next recoverable action =
  integrate TL-RR01R independently from current main. Updated 2026-09-11
  (Asia/Manila).
- Wave 1 and subsequent accepted planner evidence are integrated and pushed.
  TT-UX01R2 is independently ratified at integration merge `a0ca05e5`.
  TERM-CONSUME-C02 is independently accepted at `a55abf7e`, integrated by the
  primary planner at `5fa9b227`, and pushed through main `bb5cd487`.
  TL-UX-C01R2, DASH-RESILIENCE-C01, and MIG-GUARD-R1 have now passed primary
  planner verification and are combined on `integration/readiness-20260911`.
- TL-RR01 is independently accepted and integrated as merge `618589dc`; the
  planner pushed it to `origin/main` (`8052d727...618589dc`) after a docs-only
  `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict. `origin/main` is now `618589dc`.
- All three source lanes passed independent QA and the combined integration
  gates. The approved term schema migration is applied and verified; deploying
  the integrated runtime remains a separate service-lifecycle action.
- DEMAND-C01 through C01R2 is independently accepted and integrated at
  `b96caf40`. Derived demand and ordered-term consumers now share one authority;
  live use still requires the bounded runtime deployment and explicit rollover
  term-cache sync.
- The EnrollPro fork and canonical READ_ONLY clone were fast-forwarded to
  correction commit `5887d685`. Live probes confirm the authoritative ordered
  three-term contract for year 9 / `2030-2031` and strict malformed-ID
  rejection. The live typed `ACTIVE_TERM_UNRESOLVED` response is expected while
  the host date remains in 2026; ATLAS currently mislabels it as unreachable.
  The READ_ONLY AIMS fork and local reference clone were fast-forwarded cleanly
  to upstream commit `2332d92e`; SMART remains at `c3806e12`.
- No carry-forward apply, generation, or publication is authorized by this
  register.

## Superseded or closed streams

| Stream | State | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| SCA-01 through SCA-04 | `SUPERSEDED` | Useful evidence and year-8 transition history; the operator-facing Curriculum Requirements workflow is no longer the intended annual authority |
| GEN-C01 (`2e922d6d`) | `SUPERSEDED` | Diagnostic evidence feeds GEN-C02; do not rebase or integrate blindly because it used the split legacy demand model |
| TT-C02 / TT-C03 | `INTEGRATED` | Preview-only insertion and shared candidate invariants are represented on `origin/main` through integration commits |
| TT-C04 | `INTEGRATED` | Operator lifecycle UX hardening is on `origin/main` via `84d64437` |
| PUB-C01R3 | `INTEGRATED` | Publication authority hardening is on `origin/main` via `63a15a37`; live publication remains a separate HIGH action |
| TL-UX-C01 / TL-UX-C01R | `SUPERSEDED` | The UI consolidation remains useful, but its integrated suggestion-apply authority is superseded by TL-UX-C01R2 correction work; do not deploy the write path as accepted |
| Year-8 SCA/TL data applies | `CLOSED` | Historical transition completed; do not mistake those applies for automatic authority in the newly rolled-over year |

## Dependency-ordered queue

1. TL-UX-C01R2, DASH-RESILIENCE-C01, and MIG-GUARD-R1 are integrated; coordinate
   one bounded runtime deployment without interrupting live QA.
2. TT-UX01R2 Simple-operator closure is independently ratified at `a0ca05e5`; no further
   TT-UX01 integration step remains.
3. GEN-C02R1 (`c3744dc6`) and UX-C01R (`fc8796c6`) are integrated; TL-RR01R
   (`f66ca392`) integrates independently next. Combined readiness gates ran on
   both integration trees.
4. Coordinate the bounded runtime deployment and explicit rollover term-cache
   sync before any live year-9 preview claims.
5. Resolve GEN-C02 and Teaching Load readiness blockers and produce a zero-hard-blocker generation
   preview.
6. Obtain explicit HIGH approval, generate once, verify the completed run, then
   prepare the separate publication preview and approval.

## Safe parallel work now

- This readiness-wave integration is serialized by the planner; no parallel
  executor stream is authorized while the three candidates integrate.
- Shared `CHANGELOG.md`, runtime source maps, and this register belong to the
  integration owner; executor documentation overlap is resolved at integration.
- A bounded runtime deployment is safe only when no executor is using the
  shared Tailnet runtime for browser evidence.

DEMAND-C01 and TL-RR01 are integrated, so UX-C01 and GEN-C02R source work is
unlocked. Live Teaching Load carry-forward apply, generation, and publication
remain locked behind their separate previews, QA, and explicit approvals. Do not
restart the shared runtime while live browser QA is active.

## Awaited returns and decisions

- No DEMAND executor return remains. DEMAND-C01R2 is integrated at `b96caf40`.
- All three readiness-wave candidates passed fresh QA. GEN-C02R1 and
  UX-C01R are integrated; TL-RR01R awaits independent integration. No executor
  return remains for this wave.
- EnrollPro correction `5887d685` has been pulled and its live contract is
  available. No EnrollPro executor return is awaited.
- TERM-CONSUME-C02, DASH-RESILIENCE-C01, TL-UX-C01R2, and MIG-GUARD-R1 are
  accepted and integrated; no executor return remains for those streams.
- No migration approval is awaited; `0001_term_subject_authority` is applied and
  verified. Runtime deployment remains a separate planner-coordinated action.
- TT-UX01R2 is ratified at `a0ca05e5`; the primary planner accepts the bounded
  one-click clean-placement + prominent Undo contract. Advanced Requests and
  duplicate-publish cleanup remain non-blocking follow-ups.
- The shared runtime still needs the bounded deployment/Tailnet acceptance;
  source integration alone does not authorize data apply, generation, or
  publication.

## Update protocol

For each status change, update the affected row, the queue, safe parallel work,
and awaited returns in the same planner turn. Record only current concise truth
here; put detailed commands, test counts, findings, and correction history in
the stream's progress ledger and Git commits.

For new implementation phases, prefer the largest coherent one-shot packet
that can be completed and independently reviewed without crossing an unmet
dependency, an unresolved product decision, a conflicting worktree boundary,
or a separate HIGH action. Do not split one production contract into ceremonial
micro-phases. Keep review-found corrections narrow and additive, and keep live
data applies, generation, publication, migration, deployment, and other locked
actions behind their own explicit gates.
