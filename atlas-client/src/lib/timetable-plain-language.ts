/**
 * LANE-C-PLAIN-LANGUAGE-C03 (J1) — one plain word for one idea, stated once.
 *
 * The 2026-09-26 audit (finding 3) found the same HARD problem rendered under
 * four different names on one screen — `Must fix` (grid), `Blocked` (grid
 * badge), `blocker` (header chip) and `Hard` (summary stat) — and three
 * different "hard" numbers with nothing saying they can legitimately differ. A
 * scheduler could read `0 Hard` in one place and `3 blockers` in another and
 * conclude the product contradicts itself.
 *
 * `MUST_FIX_LABEL` is the single plain word. It is already the grid's severity
 * sign and the C1 disclosure paragraph already speaks of a rule that "breaks",
 * so reusing it introduces no new vocabulary for an older scheduler to learn.
 *
 * The three counts are genuinely different measurements and are NOT merged by
 * this module: `blockingHardCount` is the allowlist-filtered,
 * publication-relevant count, `hardCount` is every HARD, and
 * `summary.hardViolationCount` is the run's recorded total.
 * `HARD_COUNT_RELATIONSHIP_NOTE` states that relationship once in plain words,
 * so any surface showing more than one of them explains itself. No new number
 * is introduced.

/**
 * The one plain phrase for the OTHER count: every serious problem the run
 * recorded, including the ones that do not stop publishing.
 *
 * It exists because the number is genuinely different from `MUST_FIX_LABEL`:
 * `RunSummary.hardViolationCount` is the run's TOTAL, while
 * `RunSummary.blockingHardViolationCount` is the allowlist-filtered
 * publication-relevant subset (`timetableWorkspaceTruth.ts`
 * `deriveRunWideReadiness` reads them as two distinct fields, and
 * `blockingHardCount = summaryBlockingHard ?? summaryHard ?? displayHard`).
 * A surface that shows the TOTAL must therefore NOT wear the blocking word,
 * or a run with `hardViolationCount: 4, blockingHardViolationCount: 0` renders
 * "Must fix: 4" and contradicts the publish gate three lines away.
